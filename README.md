April Sonata
Our project is selling instruments that are made with organic materials. Our violins and pianos are the top best seller and our signature instruments. Users are able to have many benefits in our project as they are able to learn courses, free access to music scores, take a quiz to find which instrument they are best suited for. Additionally, 10% of user's purchase goes to preserving wildlife.  There is an infographic page at About Us which shows and tells more information about our brand.
